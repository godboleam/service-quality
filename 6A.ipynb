    "Please see 6B.py along with this notebook. In 7.py the 160 scores (150 scores for the 150 topics and 10 scores for the proxy personality traits were computed. This was computationally intensive as for each complaint for each type of loan each word was considered for computing a similarity with the proxy personality trait vector) and this could not be run in this notebook."
